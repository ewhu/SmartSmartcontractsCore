# SmartSmartcontractsCore: Blockchain-Agnostic Formal Verification for DApps
Blockchain-agnostic framework for formal verification of decentralized application business logic using symbolic model checking.

## Detailed Description

SmartSmartcontractsCore is a novel framework designed to facilitate the formal verification of decentralized application (DApp) business logic across various blockchain platforms. By leveraging symbolic model checking, our framework enables developers to rigorously test and validate the correctness of their smart contract implementations, ensuring the integrity and reliability of their decentralized systems.

The primary purpose of SmartSmartcontractsCore is to provide a blockchain-agnostic solution for formal verification, allowing developers to focus on writing correct and secure smart contract code without worrying about the underlying blockchain architecture. Our framework achieves this by abstracting away the complexities of different blockchain platforms, providing a unified interface for verifying DApp business logic.

One of the key benefits of using SmartSmartcontractsCore is the ability to catch critical errors and vulnerabilities early in the development cycle. By detecting and preventing errors at the business logic level, developers can avoid costly rewrites and ensure the trustworthiness of their decentralized applications.

Moreover, our framework provides a modular and extensible architecture, allowing developers to easily integrate new blockchain platforms and verification tools as needed. This flexibility enables SmartSmartcontractsCore to stay up-to-date with the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technology.
